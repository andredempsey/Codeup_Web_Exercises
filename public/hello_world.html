		<h1>Hello from Codeup!</h1>
		<p>Hi! I'm Andre Dempsey <br>
		I <strong>enjoy</strong> writing code and building cool programs. <br>
		My wife, Teresa, and I have been married for 22 years and she is my best friend.  <br>We are <em>lucky</em> to have two <em>wonderful</em> teenage boys.<br>
		I can't wait to put all this great knowledge from <strong>Codeup</strong> to work building innovative solutions for people<br></p>
		<h2>My favorite quote</h2>
		<blockquote>"Imagination is more important than knowledge."</blockquote>
